## üß† Motivation behind Developing this Application

Food is precious for everyone and due to poverty, there are cases where they couldn't eat for one time in a whole day. On the other side, people are wasting food unknowingly at many places like Houses, Functions, Restaurants, etc. To overcome this problem instead of wasting food we can directly handover to the poor persons. To solve this problem, I have developed this application where we took the help of Volunteers who will be helping us. 


## Working of Bhojan for All

It is simply a connection establishment between the Food Donors be it Houses, Restaurants and places where Functions happens and the Volunteers. This is an Android Application which becomes handy to the Donors as well as the Volunteers to easily interact with the app. To provide a seamless experience to the Donor, the UI is designed in such a way that it nearly takes just ***60 seconds*** to place a Food Donation in the app. The following is a representation of how the app works in real time

</div>


Since food is perishable, we have also asked some questions to Donor about the approximate time when food is prepared and it is proven that Food is not good for consumption once it crosses the time period of 6 Hours, along with we have asked the Donor to give information about the approximate quantity that the food gets sufficient in quantity of persons. Once the Volunteer has delivered the food to poor, a picture of proof will be uploaded to the app which counts as a successful donation to the Volunteer. 

We have also added an additional option for **NGOs** to login and Volunteers will also be able to deliver the food directly to the Old Age Homes, etc.

## Outcomes of this Application

- Food Donor gets self satisfied that his/her food fed to poor persons by the photo uploaded into the app once food gets donated.
- Decreases the Global Hunger Rate
- Food will not get wasted unnecessarily
- Contamination of food gets decreased
